    - fix: A bug fix has occured
    - refactor:  refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - chore: changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
    - docs: updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
    - style: formatting, comments, ...
    - perf: performance improvements
    - build: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
    - revert: reverts a previous commit
    - ressource: new or updated ressources (images, fonts, ...)
