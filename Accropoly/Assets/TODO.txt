- different ConnectingTileGroups (street, water, ...)

- water

- bug: camera transform isn't actually saved & loaded (reproduce: save world, restart scene, load world)
- get half of original price (?)
- naming consistency:
    - decide: Homeless / HomelessTag -> for all tags & components
- switch without right click
- drag to place multiple tiles
