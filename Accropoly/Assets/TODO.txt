- don't save ConnectingTile (can be calculated) (really worth the effort?)
    - extract ConnectingTile code

- camera transform isn't actually saved & loaded (reproduce: save world, restart scene, load world)
- bookmarks

FUTURE:
- get half of original price (?)
- naming consistency:
    - decide: Homeless / HomelessTag -> for all tags & components
