- errors at edges
- handle tile deletion
- improve MaterialsAndMeshesHolder performance using ecb
- simplify BuildingConnectionSystem

- don't save ConnectingTile (can be calculated) (really worth the effort?)

FUTURE:
- get half of original price (?)
- naming consistency:
    - decide: Homeless / HomelessTag -> for all tags & components
