- Don't disable Escape input action
- Finish ContinueGame(), PauseGame() & QuitGame() functions


- reactivate pause menu & scene switching
    - tileMap is serialized & world reset when the game is quit (notified via tags)
    - tileMap is deserialized when the game gets started
    - multiple scenes are unnecessary (?)
- Save components

FUTURE:
- Add namespaces (?)
- Change energy symbol color depending on renewability of the energy production
