- split rivers & lakes
- bug: camera transform isn't actually saved & loaded (reproduce: save world, restart scene, load world)
- get half of original price (?)
- naming consistency:
    - decide: Homeless / HomelessTag -> for all tags & components
    - namespaces -> Components.Homeless, System.Happiness, Authoring.BuildingSystem ...
- switch without right click
- drag to place multiple tiles
