- add population serialization
- people can also use AgingTile
- fix bug: eSystem runs before eSetup -> some entities don't have the hasETag (reproduce by spamming houses)
- who deletes the tiles??

- create school/work system
- create happiness
- create money system

- look at bookmark

- store worldData as managed component instead of static field (?)
- delete RunGameTag on pausing (?)
- add namespaces (?)

FUTURE:
- change energy symbol color depending on renewability of the energy production



- serialize pos, (personComponent / extra component added while saving)
- aspects (age, homeTile), (eConsumer, hasETag)
