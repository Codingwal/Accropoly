- find solution: don't run every frame but prevent people spawning without electricity, ... 
    - also applies for BuildingConnectionSystem
    -> run directly after spawning?
    -> set default values?

- create happiness
- create money system

- naming consistency:
    - decide: Homeless / HomelessTag -> for all tags & components
- delete RunGameTag on pausing (?)

FUTURE:
- change energy symbol color depending on renewability of the energy production
